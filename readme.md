After several attempts in 11 days. Finally I did this thing works.
The lightened way is finding many example on githubs and try to test it -> I got so many include path errors with the example in the path, though it was not necessary. The thing needed to include is /components folder. That is the library of esp-adf. Additionally, the base is esp-idf which is packed in C:\Users\ADMIN\.platformio\packages\framework-espidf 😅😅😅

Based on https://github.com/don41382/esp32-adf-max98357-with-platformio, I I found that all the things I need, then I remove the example and the whole esp-idf repository. Suddenly, it worksssssssssssss 😁🤣😍😂🤣. Many times I tried and come up with the giving-up thought. I realized that:
"Just keep it up, try one more tiny step. The gift shall come at the moment you don't think about it at all".
